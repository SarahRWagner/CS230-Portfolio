### Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Requirements

The Gaming Room wanted to upgrade their Android app, "Draw It or Lose It," to a web-based game that could run on multiple platforms. They needed the game to support several teams and players, have unique names for games and teams, and ensure only one instance of the game was running at a time.

### Evaluation of Documentation Development

I did a good job of clearly laying out the design constraints, system architecture, and domain model. The documentation also included a comparison of different operating platforms and offered recommendations tailored to what The Gaming Room needed. Creating the design document really helped organize the development process. It gave me a clear plan to follow and made sure I addressed all the necessary details systematically.

If I could change one part, I’d improve the "System Architecture View" section. Adding a detailed diagram and explanation would make it easier to understand how all the parts of the system fit together and interact.

### Implementation of User's Needs in Software Design

I listened to the user’s needs by closely analyzing the requirements for scalability, performance, and unique identifiers. Implementing these needs involved using appropriate design patterns and selecting suitable technologies. Considering the user’s needs is important as it ensures the software is functional and meets the client's expectations, ultimately leading to a successful product.

### Approach to Designing Software

I approached designing software by first understanding the requirements and constraints. I used design patterns to create a modular and scalable solution. In the future, I would use techniques such as user storiesand wireframing to ensure a more user-centric design. Additionally, incorporating regular feedback loops with stakeholders would help in refining the design continuously.
